<h1>Packages and software used in this project</h1>

<p> My first experience making a project with UI outside HTML. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html">Time</a> is used to detect how long a key is pressed. <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/">Pygame</a> is used to render the app and  display things and to detect input. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">Requests</a> is used to retrieve the HTML file recieved from <a href="pokemondb.net">PokemonDB</a> which is where the data comes from, I do not own the site. <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest//">BeautifulSoup4</a> is used to parse the HTML file to retrieve information.</p>
